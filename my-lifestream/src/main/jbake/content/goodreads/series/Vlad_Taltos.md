## Description


    This is one series set in Steven Brust's [Draegaran world.](http://www.goodreads.com/series/49760-draegara)
    
    Of the ordering, the author notes:

> One of the questions I'm most often asked is: "In what order would you recommend reading these books?" Unfortunately, I'm just exactly the wrong guy to ask. I made every effort to write them so that they could be read in any order. I am aware that, in some measure at least, I have failed (I certainly wouldn't recommend starting with <i>Teckla</i>, for example), but the fact that I was trying makes me incapable of giving an answer.
    
    Many people whose opinion I respect believe publication order is best . . . The choice, I daresay, is yours. In any case, I hope you enjoy them.
