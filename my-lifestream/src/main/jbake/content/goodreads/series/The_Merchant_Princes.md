## Description


    A bold contemporary fantasy from a science fiction star, Merchant Princes is a thrill-a-minute saga of multiple worlds. Miriam, a hip tech journalist from Boston, discovers she has alternate world relatives, and with them an elite identity she never knew was hers. But her very well-connected family is a little too much like the mafia for comfort.
