## Description


    The Revelation Space universe is a fictional universe which was created by Alastair Reynolds and used as the setting for a number of his novels and stories. Its fictional history follows the human species through various conflicts from the relatively near future (roughly 2200) to approximately AD 40000 (all the novels to date are set between 2427 and 2727, although certain stories extend beyond this period). It takes its name from Revelation Space, which was the first published novel set in the universe.
    
    The main trilogy (also known as the Inhibitor trilogy) consists of 1) Revelation Space, 2) Redemption Ark and 3) Absolution Gap, and deals with humanity coming to the attention of the inhibitors and the resultant war between them.
    
    Chasm City is the second novel published which is set in the Revelation Space universe, and takes place before the main trilogy but after the The Prefect and most of the short stories and novellas. It is a standalone novel, with some characters playing a role in the main trilogy.
    
    The Prefect is the fifth novel published which is set in the Revelation Space universe, and takes place prior to the four previously released Revelation Space novels, but after some of the short stories. Like Chasm City, it is a standalone novel, containing no characters from any other Revelation Space works.
    
    The reading order for Alastair Reynolds' Revelation Space universe stories is complex, with the novels overlapping with the short stories (collected in Galactic North) and the two novellas (collected in Diamond Dogs, Turquoise Days).
    
    This is the chronological order for the short stories, novels and novellas:
    
    Great Wall of Mars* - <i>(2205, published February 2000)</i>
    Glacial* - <i>(2217, published March 2001)</i>
    A Spy in Europa* - <i>(ca. 2330 - 2340, published 1997)</i>
    Weather* - <i>(2358, published 2006)</i>
    The Prefect (Novel, Standalone) - <i>(2427, published 2007)</i>
    Diamond Dogs** - <i>(ca. 2500 - 2550, published 2001)</i>
    Monkey Suit*** - <i>(ca. 2511, published 2009)</i>
    Dilation Sleep* - <i>(ca. 2513 - 2540, published 1990)</i>
    Chasm City (Novel, Standalone) - <i>(ca. 2517 - 2524, published 2001)</i>
    Grafenwalder's Bestiary* - <i>(ca. 2540, published 2006)</i>
    Turquoise Days** - <i>(2541, published 2002)</i>
    Revelation Space (Novel, #1 of the main trilogy) - <i>(2524 - 2567, published 2000)</i>
    Nightingale* - <i>(ca. 2600, published 2006)</i>
    Redemption Ark (Novel, #2 of the main trilogy) - <i>(2605 - 2651, published 2002)</i>
    Absolution Gap (Novel, #3 of the main trilogy) - <i>(ca. 2615 - 3125, published 2003)</i>
    Galactic North* - <i>(ca. 2303 - 40000, published 1999)</i>

    Whether the chronological order is the best reading order for the books or not is debatable. It mostly works, although The Prefect may have more impact if read after the main trilogy (Revelation Space, Redemption Ark, Absolution Gap) when the reader is more familiar with the Conjoiner and Ultra factions. Also 'Weather' contains the answer to a major mystery from the main trilogy about the Conjoiner lighthugger drives and may benefit from being read later on.
    
    'Great Wall of Mars' and 'Glacial' should definitely be read before the main trilogy, as they introduce characters who otherwise show up out of nowhere in Redemption Ark, and 'Galactic North' (the story) should be read after everything else as it explains the ending to Absolution Gap and puts something of a full stop on the whole series and story. Chasm City can be read before or after the main trilogy, but benefits much more from being read before as some of its characters play a role in Revelation Space.
