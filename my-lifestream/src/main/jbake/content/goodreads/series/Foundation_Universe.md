## Description


    Asimov's <i>Foundation Universe</i> consists of the [Empire](http://www.goodreads.com/series/43817-galactic-empire) series, [Foundation](http://www.goodreads.com/series/43939-foundation) series, and [Robot](http://www.goodreads.com/series/49175-robot) series. Originally published as separate series, Asimov later combined them into one universe.
    
    This gave the series a total of 15 novels and a time-span of approximately 20,000 years across the whole series.
    
    The following books are listed in Asimov's suggested reading order from the published work <i>Prelude to Foundation</i>.
