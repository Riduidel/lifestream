## Description


    The Stone was from space--but perhaps not our space. It came from the future--but perhaps not our future. And within the hollowed asteroid was the remains of a vanished civilization. A human civilization. One that tells the history of the Death--incredible catastrophes--just about to occur on Earth.
    
    But in this science fiction series from bestselling author Greg Bear, that's only the beginning. The Stone will yield a secret that makes even Earth's survival pale in comparison.
