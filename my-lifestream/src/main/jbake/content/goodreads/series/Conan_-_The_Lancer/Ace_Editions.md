## Description


    The first comprehensive paperback edition, which compiled the existing Howard and non-Howard stories together with new non-Howard stories in chronological order, to form a complete account of Conan's life. Lancer Books initially numbered its volumes in order of publication, switching to a chronological numbering for volumes published later and reprints or the earlier volumes. Lancer went out of business before bringing out the entire series, and publication was completed by Ace Books.
    
    This edition of the stories was the one that introduced Conan into popular culture. Undertaken under the direction of De Camp and Carter, it includes all the original Howard material, including that left unpublished in his lifetime and fragments and outlines. De Camp edited much of the material and he and Carter completed the stories that were not in finished form. New stories written entirely by themselves were added as well. In the following list, volumes 6 and 11â€“12 do not contain any material by Howard. Of the thirty-five stories in the other eight volumes, nineteen were published or completed by Howard during his lifetime, ten are rewritten or completed from his manuscripts, fragments or synopses, and six are the sole work of De Camp and Carter. Most of the covers of this edition featured dynamic images by Frank Frazetta that, for many fans, presented the "definitive" impression of Conan and his world.
