## Description


    Thousands of years from now, a mind's potential is determined by its location in space—from superintelligent entities in the Transcend, to the limited minds of the Unthinking Depths, where only simple creatures and technology can function. Nobody knows what strange force partitioned space into these "regions of thought," but when the warring Straumli realm use an ancient Transcendent artifact as a weapon, they unwittingly unleash an awesome power that destroys thousands of worlds and enslaves all natural and artificial intelligence.
    
    Vernor Vinge first used the concepts of <i>"Zones of Thought"</i> in a 1988 novella, <i>"The Blabber"</i>, which occurs after Fire. Vinge's novel, <i>A Deepness in the Sky</i>, is a prequel to <i>A Fire Upon the Deep</i> set 20,000 years earlier and featuring Pham Nuwen. Vinge's <i>Children of the Sky</i> is "a near-term sequel to A Fire Upon the Deep", set ten years later.
    
    Vinge's former wife, Joan D. Vinge, has also written stories in the Zones of Thought universe, based on his notes. These include <i>"The Outcasts of Heaven Belt"</i> and <i>"Legacy"</i>.
    
    Vernor Vinge won a Hugo Award for <i>A Fire Upon the Deep</i>. He also won a Hugo, a John W. Campbell and a Prometheus Award for <i>A Deepness in the Sky</i>.
