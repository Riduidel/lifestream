    The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy trilogy written by English philologist and University of Oxford professor J.R.R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's earlier, less complex children's fantasy novel [book:The Hobbit|5907] (1937), but eventually developed into a much larger work which formed the basis for the extended [Middle-Earth Universe](http://www.goodreads.com/series/58083-middle-earth-universe). It was written in stages between 1937 and 1949, much of it during World War II. It is the third best-selling novel ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.
