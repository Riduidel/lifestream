# Oh my god, I've totally JDOized the server ! 

Well ...   
I would have liked to do a joke on Jeopardy and the such (seeing how   
JDO based development can be a nightmare) but no one comes in mind for   
now.   
So, to mke long things short ... I've uploaded v2 of knackfx server   
code. This one uses JDO magic instead of raw code. It may be little   
more conveninent (excepeted when relationship comes in play, in which   
case it's just a f***ing hellish nightmare), and it should work on a   
large scale application.   
Next step ? Guarding the REST code, for you to use it freely.
