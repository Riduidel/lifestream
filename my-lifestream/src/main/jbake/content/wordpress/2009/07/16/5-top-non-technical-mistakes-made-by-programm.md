# 5 top non-technical mistakes made by programmers

Tr??s int??ressant, cet article qui est arriv?? dans mon Google Reader depuis le blog de Xebia.  
La grande question est : de ces cinq d??fauts, lesquels sont les miens ?  
Bon, apr??s y avoir longuement r??fl??chi, il semble que ce soit le cas pour les cinq d??fauts mentionn??s, d'une fa??on ou d'une autre. Maintenant, comment y rem??dier ? A grands coups de discipline ? J'ai pourtant l'impression d'en avoir d??j?? un sacr?? paquet, de discipline ...

Unfortunately some developers focus only on the technical part. When this happens they will develop some bad habits from which the following are the 5 top non-technical mistakes:

##1.- Lack of discipline.

##

[???Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment.???](http://thinkexist.com/quotation/discipline_is_the_bridge_between_goals_and/210477.html) Jim Rohn.

I???ve always thought that discipline is one of the most valuable skills, not only for being a software developer, but to be successful at any other area in life It is also true that usually it is very hard to find people who are both brilliant and disciplined.

[ Steve Pavlina](http://www.stevepavlina.com) highlight the 5 pillars of self discipline????? *???[...]Acceptance, Willpower, Hard Work, Industry, and Persistence. If you take the first letter of each word, you get the acronym ???A WHIP??? ??? a convenient way to remember them, since many people associate self-discipline with whipping themselves into shape.[...]*??? I highly recommend to read his [series of articles in self discipline](http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/06/self-discipline/).

As I explained in my previous article: [5 tips for creating good code every day](http://www.makinggoodsoftware.com/2009/05/15/5-tips-for-creating-good-code-every-day-how-to-become-a-good-software-developer/), my personal approach is to follow these steps every day.
* Have your own to do list for the day
* Do one thing at a time
* Do it right
* Don???t finish something until it???s completely done
* Better late than sorry BUT better sorry than never.

##2.- Big egos.

##

My experience says that big egos and programmers go hand by hand, the main problem of having a big ego is that it actually prevents you from realizing that you have a big ego, a few indicators that may help you to know if your ego is way too big are:
* You consider yourself the best programmer.
* You block conversations.
* You ask for code reviews not to get criticism but to show how good your code is.

There are many good articles about programmers and their ego in the Internet, I would recommend two of them, this article from Mike Bernat: [Egoless programmin](http://mikebernat.com/blog/Egoless_Programming_-_Developing_Without_the_Attitude) and from stackoverflow.com [this discussion thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/229393/how-do-you-control-your-programmer-ego).

##3.- Being a bad communicator.

##

[???If I am to speak ten minutes, I need a week for preparation; if fifteen minutes, three days; if half an hour, two days; if an hour, I am ready now](http://www.wisdomquotes.com/000747.html)???. Woodrow Wilson

As human beings communication is our main activity. Being a good communicator is hard but essential in our profession, we are continuously exchanging opinions about designs, code, having peer reviews, writing documentation, trying to convince someone else that our design is better, writing code???

Good communicators are those people that when they are explaining something, their explanation is:
* **Focus**. They just talk about what is need to be understand.
* **Clear**. Easy to understand.
* **Concise**. Nothing to be added, nothing to be taken.

For being a better communicator, I have two advices:
* If you think you are not a good communicator, prepare what you are going to say until is focus, clear and concise.
* If engaged in a conversation, first listen, then think and then talk.

There are a few more tips for improving communication when having a meeting in this previous article I published ???[7 best practices for taking decisions in the development team](http://www.makinggoodsoftware.com/2009/04/24/7-best-practices-for-taking-decisions-in-the-development-team/)???.

##4.- Forgetting about the customer.

##

**

You are there just for one reason- your customer. It???s easy sometimes to forget this point. I have been in teams where focus was on technologies and platforms rather than in having a happy customer. We would expend months creating a framework that didn???t deliver any value to the customer, and by the time we were about to start using it, we would discover that it won???t fit our user needs.

##5.- Not prioritizing the work properly.

##

Developers who are always [gold plating](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_plating), researching new and more interesting technologies, over engineering solutions or just doing whatever they find more cool are impediments to the project, I???m not saying that is not normal to engage into lateral activities from time to time, we all need distractions, but if you find yourself usually in the previous situations you may reconsider the way you prioritize your work, again I will recommend you to read [5 tips for creating good code every day.](http://www.makinggoodsoftware.com/2009/05/15/5-tips-for-creating-good-code-every-day-how-to-become-a-good-software-developer/)<img height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MakingGoodSoftware/~4/ckjtvkcHKk0" width="1"></img>
