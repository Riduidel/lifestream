# Posterous backup, an upgrade

This message is an update to [the previous one](http://riduidel.posterous.com/posterous-backup-beta-reached).  
it is due to my users being true bentlemen, that wants nothing more than a sweet script allowing them to do whatever kind of backup they want.

One of these users, [Eli](http://posterous.com/people/Q0cYj5KwY9), asked me if it was possible to save images in another folder than the messages one.

As a matter of fact, I thought it would be even more convenient to have ilmages stored in a folder named from the message.

As a consequence, I added a new flag to posterous backup command line : "-s". When using this flag, images are all stored in a folder named like the message url.

When opitting it, the "historical" mode has been kept, and all images are saved alongside the messages.

Obviously, you can download that script by following that link : [download it immediatly and without any kind of nagware](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2753331/posterous.groovy).
