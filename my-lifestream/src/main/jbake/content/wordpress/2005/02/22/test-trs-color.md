# Test tr??s color??

Dans la s√©rie des tests ridicules, celui [d'aujourd'hui](http://www.spacefem.com/colorquiz/) (merci JF) me rend khaki :

<table border="1" width="50%"><tbody><tr><td><span style="color:#000000;"><big>you are khaki</big><br></br>#F0E68C</span></td></tr><tr><td><span style="color:#000000;"><br></br>Your dominant hues are red and green, so you're definately not afraid to get in and stir things up. You have no time for most people's concerns, you'd rather analyze with your head than be held back by some random "gut feeling".<p>Your saturation level is lower than average - You don't stress out over things and don't understand people who do. Finishing projects may sometimes be a challenge, but you schedule time as you see fit and the important things all happen in the end, even if not everyone sees your grand master plan.</p><p>Your outlook on life is bright. You see good things in situations where others may not be able to, and it frustrates you to see them get down on everything.<br></br></p></span></td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://spacefem.com/colorquiz">the spacefem.com html color quiz</a></td></tr></tbody></table>
